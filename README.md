# ✈️AIRLINE REVIEW CLASSIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING 

### 📊PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
In today's interconnected world, the airline industry serves as a critical catalyst for global travel and business. As air travel becomes increasingly accessible, the quality of service provided by airlines plays a pivotal role in shaping passenger experiences. 

This project focuses on the development of an airline review classification system using Classification models such as Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier etc., The proliferation of social media platforms, travel websites, and online forums has given rise to a wealth of user-generated content, including airline reviews. Extracting actionable insights from this vast pool of unstructured text data has the potential to provide airlines with valuable information for refining their services and elevating passenger satisfaction. Throughout this report, we will delve into the methodology employed to preprocess the raw text data, the process of selecting pertinent features, the training and evaluation of the classification model, and the subsequent interpretation of the obtained results.

### 🎯Objective: 
To develop a machine learning model to classify airline reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
### 🛫Motivation: 
Airline reviews are a valuable source of feedback for airlines. By understanding the sentiment of airline reviews, airlines can identify areas where they need to improve their services. This can lead to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.
### 📌Approach: 
The project will use a machine learning algorithm to train a model on a dataset of airline reviews. The model will be trained to identify the sentiment of each review and to classify it as positive, negative, or neutral.
